#Markdown
##Using pl/sql to turn a text formatted in markdown into html.

Done so far is setting up a unit test using [sql developer][1].
The tests are created with the help of [John Gruber's Dingus site][2].  
This project will be starting with just plain Markdown as invented by John Gruber.  
Later on other flavours (like the one of github) will most likely be added.
